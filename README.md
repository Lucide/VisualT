# VisualT
VisualT is a text-based graphic library written in C.\
It originated as a personal project (v1.0), when I was in the 4th year of high school (12th grade for overseas readers), and we had been studying programming (along with the C language) the year before.

The idea is to recreate an environment similar to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/ "www.scratch.mit.edu") in C, with graphic "Objects" (*Sprites in scratch*) and "Sprites" (*Costumes in scratch*). Objects are represented as `.obj` text files which can be imported or embedded directly within the source.
